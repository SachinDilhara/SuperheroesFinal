# Superheroes
This website is dedicated to superheroes and provides a platform for users to explore and learn about various types of superheroes. It offers information about superhumans, mutants, tech-based heroes, and anti-heroes. The website showcases a collection of superhero images and provides brief descriptions of each character. Users can click on the images to view more details about each superhero.

I used HTML, CSS and Java Script to make this website.
