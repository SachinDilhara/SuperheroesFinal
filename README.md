This website is dedicated to superheroes and provides a platform for users to explore and learn about various types of superheroes.
It offers information about superhumans, mutants, tech-based heroes, and anti-heroes. The website showcases a collection of superhero images and provides brief 
descriptions of each character. Users can click on the images to view more details about each superhero. This is the final version of my superheroes project. so I add 
some new features to this website using PHP. with the help of this new features user can register in this website. logged in users can add new superheroes to this website.
