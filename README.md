# SuperheroesFinal
This website is dedicated to superheroes and provides a platform for users to explore and learn about various types of superheroes. It offers information about superhumans, mutants, tech-based heroes, and anti-heroes. The website showcases a collection of superhero images and provides brief descriptions of each character. Users can click on the images to view more details about each superhero. This is a Final version of my superheroes project. now user can log in to this website and add superheroes to the website. with this new feature users can get knowledge about various superheroes.
